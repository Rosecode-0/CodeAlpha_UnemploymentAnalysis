# CodeAlpha_UnemploymentAnalysis

##  Project Title: Unemployment Analysis with Python

###  Objective:
To analyze the unemployment rate across different regions and areas using Python.  
The goal is to explore unemployment trends and draw insights that could help inform economic and social policies.

---

###  Dataset:
- The dataset contains details such as:
  - **Region**
  - **Frequency** (Indicates report frequency, but no timestamp)
  - **Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)**
  - **Estimated Employed**
  - **Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%)**
  - **Area** (Urban/Rural)

>  Note: The dataset **does not include date/time information**, so time-series analysis was not possible.

---

###  Technologies Used:
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook** / **VS Code**

---

###  Steps Performed:

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed extra spaces from column names using `.str.strip()`
   - Handled missing or inconsistent values

2. **Data Exploration & Visualization**
   - Region-wise Unemployment Rate using `boxplot`
   - Area-wise Unemployment Rate comparison
   - Distribution of unemployment across the dataset

---

###  Visual Insights:

- Regions show varying levels of unemployment distribution.
- Urban and rural areas differ in average unemployment percentages.
- Distribution curve helps understand concentration and outliers.

---

###  Conclusion:

Though time-based analysis wasnâ€™t possible due to missing date info, the dataset still revealed significant patterns when categorized by **region** and **area**.

This task enhanced understanding of:
- Data visualization techniques
- Real-world dataset handling
- Communicating insights through plots
